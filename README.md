### AI-Powered Smart Attendance Management System

Automatic classroom attendance using **Face Recognition**, **Voice Biometrics**, and **QR-based Subject Enrollment**.

</div>

---

# 📌 Overview

ATTEND AI is an intelligent attendance management platform that automates classroom attendance using Artificial Intelligence.

Students register once by enrolling their facial features and optional voice biometrics. Teachers can then mark attendance automatically from classroom photographs, eliminating manual roll calls and reducing attendance fraud.

The system is built using Streamlit, Supabase, OpenCV, Face Recognition, and Resemblyzer.
